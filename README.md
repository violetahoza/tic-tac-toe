# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This repository contains my implementation of the **Tic-Tac-Toe** game using **Python** and **Prover9**, a resolution-based automated theorem prover. The game is designed to not only follow the traditional rules of Tic-Tac-Toe but also incorporates Prover9 logic to validate moves, check for winners, and enhance the overall game experience.


## Project Overview

**Tic-Tac-Toe** is a two-player game played on a **3x3 grid** where each player takes turns marking their chosen symbol ('X' or 'O'). The game ends when one player aligns three marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or when the board is full and no one wins.

While the Tic-Tac-Toe game itself is a simple and popular two-player game, the inclusion of Prover9, a resolution-based automated theorem prover for first-order and propositional logic, enhances the gameâ€™s decision-making and validation processes. Through Prover9, the game not only checks for winners but also ensures that the game follows correct logical rules by reasoning about the possible moves.
